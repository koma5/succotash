# succotash
This fancy website serves as my personal portiolio and puts on display the things I made. Because a tabular version was to lame I built a graph with colorful circles.

The graph is made from linked data which is accsesible as [turtle] or [rdf-xml]. The javascript renders the graph on page-load from these files.

The selection of the circles is bound to the #anchor of the page.

Because the site itself is a thing I made you can select the circle representing itself on itself [#succotash].

Which makes it possible to share the link to a specific node/circle.

The data available in multiple languanges. The javascript is selecting which language to display based on the locale of the browser.
